# Schema snapshot gate

Mimir's Postgres schema is the ordered `SCHEMA_STATEMENTS` list in `lib/db.ts`,
applied by `ensureSchema()` on the first query of a cold process. There is no
separate migration runner, so a schema edit takes effect as soon as it deploys.
The snapshot gate makes that change visible in review:

```bash
npm ci
npm run check:schema-snapshot            # verify (CI gate)
npm run check:schema-snapshot -- --write # regenerate after a reviewed change
```

The check is pure: no `DATABASE_URL`, no network, no seeds, and no production
secrets. It exports the schema definition (`getSchemaStatements()`), rebuilds the
snapshot in memory, and compares it with the committed artifact at
`schemas/db-schema.snapshot.json`.

## What the snapshot pins

- **Fingerprint.** SHA-256 over every statement, canonicalised for whitespace and
  including its bound arguments. Any edit — schema, migration registration, or
  seed insert — changes the fingerprint and fails the gate.
- **Tables and indexes.** The `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` / `CREATE INDEX IF NOT
  EXISTS` names, so a new table or index is reported explicitly.
- **Migrations.** Every row inserted into `schema_migrations`
  (`migration_id`, `schema_version`, `checksum`, `applied_at`).

A snapshot is valid only when the machine speaks `schemaVersion: 1`, uses
`sha256`, and carries a 64-character lowercase-hex fingerprint. Garbage JSON is
rejected rather than treated as verified.

## Failure behaviour

The gate fails closed. `ok` is true only when there are zero error findings:

- `SNAPSHOT_MISSING` / `SNAPSHOT_INVALID` — the committed snapshot is absent or
  unreadable.
- `EMPTY_SCHEMA` — the source produced no statements; an empty schema is never
  treated as verified.
- `FINGERPRINT_MISMATCH`, `TABLE_DRIFT`, `INDEX_DRIFT`, `MIGRATION_DRIFT` — the
  source and the committed snapshot disagree.
- `MIGRATION_DUPLICATE_VERSION` — the same `schema_version` is registered twice.
- `MIGRATION_UNREGISTERED` — the schema creates tables but registers no
  `schema_migrations` row, so a migration was added without being recorded.

Findings name the tables, indexes, or migrations involved and print the exact
remediation command. They never include row data, addresses, or secrets.

## Release, rollback, artifact, and environment

- **Release.** CI runs `npm run check:schema-snapshot` before typecheck. A failing
  gate blocks the pull request; do not bypass it. Run it locally alongside
  typecheck, node tests, contract tests, and release checks before merging a
  schema change.
- **Artifact.** The only artifact is the committed
  `schemas/db-schema.snapshot.json`. Regenerate it with `-- --write` in the same
  pull request as the schema edit, review the diff, and commit both together.
- **Secrets.** None. The check requires no environment variable; `lib/db.ts` is
  imported for its statement list only and never opens a pool.
- **Environment.** The verdict is identical on a clean checkout, in CI, and on a
  developer machine. It does not depend on database contents, chain state, or
  network reachability.
- **Rollback.** Revert the schema change and the snapshot together, then rerun
  `npm run check:schema-snapshot`. Reverting only one of the two leaves the gate
  failing, which is intended. Because the chain is the source of truth, a
  problematic table can also be dropped by applying a reviewed compensating
  statement and re-snapshotting; the read index remains disposable and can be
  rebuilt with `npm run warm:vs-index`.
