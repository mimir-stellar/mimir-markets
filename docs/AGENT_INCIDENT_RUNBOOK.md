# Agent key and tool incident runbook

Every switch, where it is enforced and how it rolls back: [`INCIDENT_KILL_SWITCHES.md`](INCIDENT_KILL_SWITCHES.md). Switches take only the value `1`.

1. Pause only the affected surface: `MIMIR_PAUSE_RESEARCH`, `MIMIR_PAUSE_X402_BUYING`, `MIMIR_PAUSE_COPY_EXECUTION`, or funded actions. For one actor use `RESEARCH_PAUSED_AGENT_IDS`, `MIMIR_PAUSED_X402_BUYERS`, or the wallet policy's `paused` bit. Withdrawal/read paths stay available.
2. Owner revokes the compromised operator immediately. Nonces and outstanding sessions are invalidated; do not rotate from the operator key.
3. Owner registers/rotates to a fresh operator wallet, re-grants the minimum capabilities and sets conservative daily/session/position limits. Never reuse or upload the old private key.
4. Reconcile agent request audit, copy execution attribution, x402 payment identifiers and onchain events from the last known-good timestamp. Duplicate idempotency keys and unknown targets are incident indicators.
5. Run dry-run/simulation for create, stake and copy with the replacement key. Re-enable one capability at a time and watch request, source-failure and exposure counters.

## Oracle settlement transaction incident

`resolve_claim` is the only funded write retried by the oracle. The worker classifies
failures before retrying:

- malformed verdict/input: aborts; it is never converted into a refund or replayed;
- stale / `NotYetExpired` / inactive snapshot: refreshes Soroban state and defers;
- duplicate / already resolved: no-op, because the chain is already final;
- cancelled: no-op, because cancelled claims are refunded by the contract;
- `MIMIR_PAUSE_ORACLE_SETTLEMENT=1`: defers before evidence, LLM, or signing;
- dependency / RPC / timeout failures: bounded exponential retry, then defer to the
  next poll. The worker never retries from a stale snapshot.

If a submission outcome is ambiguous, reconcile the retained transaction hash and
fresh `get_claim` state before any manual action. Do not issue a manual payout,
edit the read index, or delete a claim to make a retry appear successful. Soroban
state is authoritative; a later poll is the rollback mechanism for a deferred
attempt. To roll back this change, disable `MIMIR_PAUSE_ORACLE_SETTLEMENT` only
after the RPC and oracle balance are healthy, or deploy the previous worker; no
contract migration or ledger reversal is required.

Compromise never permits editing historical owner-fee attribution. A revoked agent remains terminal; re-admission is a new registration.
