/**
 * Pins the fail-closed contract of `lib/ci/path-scope.ts`.
 *
 * The one property that matters: a changed path either maps to a known tier or
 * it is UNKNOWN, and UNKNOWN never silently enables nothing. Every test here
 * guards a way the filter could regress into failing open — a new directory
 * nobody classified, a root file that skips the suites it affects, a doc file
 * treated as scoped, or a fan-out file that stops fanning out.
 *
 * Keep in sync with `scripts/ci/changed-paths.mjs` (checked by
 * `npm run check:driver-parity`, not by this file).
