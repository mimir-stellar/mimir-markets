/**
 * Fail-closed changed-path classification for CI.
 *
 * The one rule this module encodes: CI decides what to run from an *allowlist*.
 * A changed path either matches a known scope and enables it, or it matches
 * nothing and is UNKNOWN. Unknown paths fail the path job — they never
 * silently skip the suites they were invisible to. Filters that fail open are
 * worse than no filters at all: they turn a green check into a lie about what
 * was actually verified.
 *
 * Consumers:
 *  - `scripts/ci/changed-paths.mjs` re-implements the classification contract
 *    for the workflow driver (plain Node, no TS pipeline — see that file).
 *  - `tests/node/ci-path-scope.test.ts` pins the behaviour that matters:
 *    defaults, shared-file fan-out, doc-only exclusion, and the fail-closed
 *    default. If this file and the driver ever drift, those tests plus
 *    `check:driver-parity` are what catch it.
 *
 * Keep in sync with `scripts/ci/changed-paths.mjs` (same lists, same rules).
