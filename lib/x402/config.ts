 *
 * ── Why there is no facilitator URL here any more ────────────────────────────
 *
 * The EVM-era layer pointed at `x402.org`/CDP because `exact` on EVM is EIP-3009:
 * the buyer signs a `transferWithAuthorization` and a THIRD PARTY submits it and
 * pays the gas. Verification and settlement had to happen somewhere the payer was
 * not.
 *
 * On Stellar a fee is ~0.00001 XLM, so the buyer just submits its own payment and
 * presents the transaction hash. "Verify + settle" collapses into "read Horizon",
 * which Mimir does in-process — see {@link X402_SETTLEMENT_SOURCE}. The x402 SDK
 * still wants a `FacilitatorClient` object (its `initialize()` throws when no
 * facilitator advertises any supported kind), so `./stellar-scheme.ts` supplies a
 * local one that answers out of memory instead of over the network.
