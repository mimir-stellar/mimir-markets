/**
 * Mimir's Stellar-native x402 payment scheme — `exact` on `stellar:testnet`.
 *
 * This module is the whole mechanism: the buyer half, the seller half, and the
 * local stand-in for what used to be an HTTP facilitator. It implements the real
 * `@x402/core` v2.21 interfaces (`SchemeNetworkClient`, `SchemeNetworkServer`,
 * `SchemeNetworkFacilitator`, `FacilitatorClient`) — nothing here is a shim
 * around an EVM shape.
 *
 * ── Why the flow is different from `exact` on EVM ────────────────────────────
 *
 * EVM `exact` is EIP-3009: the buyer SIGNS a `transferWithAuthorization` and hands
 * the signature over; a facilitator submits it, pays the gas, and reports back.
 * That indirection exists because gas is expensive enough that somebody has to
 * sponsor it and because an EVM account cannot cheaply pay per HTTP request.
 *
 * A Stellar operation costs ~100 stroops (0.00001 XLM). So the buyer simply pays,
 * and presents PROOF OF A PAYMENT THAT ALREADY LANDED:
 *
 *   1. Buyer gets a 402 carrying `{ amount, asset, payTo, network }`.
 *   2. Buyer submits a classic `Payment` operation on `USDC:GBBD47…` for at least
 *      `amount` to `payTo`, and waits for Horizon to return the result.
 *   3. Buyer signs a canonical proof message (Ed25519, the payer's own key) and
 *      sends `{ transaction, payer, signature }` as the payment payload.
 *   4. Seller reads that transaction back off Horizon and checks it is a real,
 *      successful, recent payment of the right asset and amount to the right
 *      account, made by the account that signed the proof.
 *
 * Verification is a Horizon read, so there is no third party and no HTTP
 * facilitator. `x402ResourceServer` still needs a `FacilitatorClient` — its
 * `initialize()` throws when no facilitator advertises a supported kind — so
 * {@link LocalStellarFacilitatorClient} answers those three calls in-process.
 *
 * ── Why the payload is SIGNED, not just a transaction hash ───────────────────
 *
 * A landed transaction hash is public and permanent. If the proof were the hash
 * alone, anyone watching Horizon could lift a payment out of the ledger inside the
 * freshness window and spend it on their own request — a bearer token published to
 * the world by construction. Requiring an Ed25519 signature by the payment's
 * SOURCE ACCOUNT over `{network, transaction, payTo, amount, asset}` means the
 * proof is only usable by whoever holds the paying key. Same primitive, and the
 * same "the public key is an input, not an output" property, as
 * `lib/stellar-message.ts`.
 *
 * ── Replay ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * See {@link consumeSettlement}. Stellar's sequence numbers stop a signed
 * transaction from being SUBMITTED twice, but nothing stops an already-landed hash
 * from being PRESENTED twice, and the payments ledger's unique index alone does
 * not deny the second request — `insertPayment` is `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` and
 * runs in `onAfterSettle`, i.e. after the paid response was already produced. So
 * settlement claims the hash first: durably against `payments_v2`, and in-process
 * for the window before that row exists.

 *  - **In-process:** the durable row is written by `recordPayment` in
