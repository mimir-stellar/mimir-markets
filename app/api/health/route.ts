/**
 * Operational health probe.
 *
 * Public but deliberately thin: severities, thresholds and the measurements
 * behind them, and nothing about users, markets or addresses. A status page
 * nobody can reach during an incident is not a status page, so this stays
 * unauthenticated - which is also why it must never leak anything an attacker
 * could use.
 *
 * Returns 503 only when something is actually broken. A warning stays 200,
 * because a load balancer that pulls the app out of rotation over a slow research
 * source turns a degradation into an outage. */
